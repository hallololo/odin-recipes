    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salted butter softened</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salted butter melted</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter softened</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, butter, and eggs. Add in flour. Using a dough hook, turn the on to a low speed.</li>
        <li>Once the flour starts to incorporate into the dough, increase the speed to a medium range. Add more flour as necessary so that the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. The dough mixture should be tacky, but not stick to your hands. It should be soft. Add more or less flour until the dough reaches the desired consistency. The amount of flour you add in bread making is always an approximation and you should go by feel.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly greased mixing bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a baking sheet or 9x13 pan. Punch down the dough and roll into a 12inch by 18inch rectangle.</li>
        <li>Brush the dough with 1/2 cup melted butter. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle on top of the melted butter. Roll up tightly lengthwise so you have one long roll. Use plain dental floss or a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 one-inch slices.</li>
        <li>Place the slices onto a lightly 9x13 pan. Cover and let rise 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Bake the rolls for about 14 minutes, until just kissed with brown on top.</li>
        <li>While the cinnamon rolls are baking, make the cream cheese glaze by using a hand mixer to whip together cream cheese and butter in a bowl until light and fluffy. Whip in powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Add enough milk to achieve a drizzle-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Frost the rolls while still warm. Serve immediately or cool and store. Stays good for 4 to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
